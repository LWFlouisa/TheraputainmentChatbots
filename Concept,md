## My Prompt
So to put it all together. Self learning autonomous narrative agent with distorted memories that makes the meta-engine more human like, with the goal of the agent acting as a therapy system, to self guide the user to explore their own memories, with Ruby acting as the meta-engine for episodic memories?

## Phind Says
To create a self-learning autonomous narrative agent with distorted memories that acts as a therapy system, you can follow these steps:

1. **Develop a Ruby-based meta-engine**: Create a Ruby-based backend to handle episodic memories, manage connections between the narrative agent and the front-end, and enable data exchange between the front-end and the meta-engine.

2. **Design the front-end with Ren'Py**: Use Ren'Py to create the interactive narrative experience, focusing on the therapeutic aspect of the agent's interactions with the user. Ren'Py will help you create branching narratives and integrate multimedia elements to facilitate the exploration of memories and emotions.

3. **Integrate the narrative agent with the Ruby meta-engine**: Connect the Ren'Py front-end to the Ruby meta-engine, allowing the narrative agent to interact with the episodic memories and learn from them. This can be done by implementing APIs or other communication methods to enable data exchange between the front-end and the meta-engine.

4. **Incorporate self-learning and distorted memories**: As the narrative agent interacts with users, it should learn from their experiences and incorporate distorted memories to create a more nuanced and personalized narrative. You can refer to [Source 2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-021-00581-2) for insights on the trade-offs between correspondence and coherence in narrative selves and the role of self-enhancement. This can be done by implementing machine learning algorithms or other AI techniques to improve the agent's understanding and adapt its responses over time.

5. **Design the narrative agent as a therapy system**: Based on the research presented in [Source 3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-017-0935-0) and [Source 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389041723000335), develop a narrative agent that can interact with users to help them explore their own memories and emotions. This can be achieved by incorporating distributed cognition theory and understanding the different aspects of self-patterns, such as narrative goals, cognitive abilities, and social learning.
By following these steps, you can create a self-learning autonomous narrative agent with distorted memories that acts as a therapy system, using Ruby as the meta-engine for episodic memories and Ren'Py for the front-facing part. This approach will enable users to engage with the narrative agent and think about the context in a meaningful way, while also allowing the agent to learn and adapt its responses based on user interactions. 

## Summary
